# fake-product-website
To find out the fake reviews in the website and to differentiate whether the review is genuine or fake this project “FAKE PRODUCT DETECTION WEBSITE” is implemented. The system will find out the fake review by identifying the IP addresses by the review pattern.
System works as follows:
	User will be able to login using user ID and password and the user can buy the product and review about the product.
	Admin will have another login page where the admin can login using email id and password.
	Admin can add products to the website.
	Admin can delete the product from the website.
	User once access the system user can view product and can post review about the product.
	If the system observes fake reviews and if its coming from the same user ,IP address will be tracked by the system and will inform the admin to remove the review from the system.
